Team Members and Contribution: 
------------------------------------------------------------
Dan Doan:
In charge of the airports server and the creation of kd-tree structure to handle data. Handles input of longitude and latitude and searches through a constructed kd-tree from data in airports.txt to find locations and implements methodology to return 5 nearest neighbors. Researched many libraries and methods in order for the kd-tree to function properly.

Steven Nguyen:
In charge of the communication between places client and places server, and the communication between places server and airports server. Designed the mode of connecting the two servers together. Implemented the data structure for the places server and stored the data from places2k.txt into the data structure. Also assisted on the functionality of the airports server ensuring the kd-tree methodology. Co-worked on the Makefile.

Mason Kam:
Designed the methodology for the places server data structure and algorithm to store and search for a given place. Implemented a modified binary search algorithm in the places server in order to be able to account for prefixes of places and the possible multiple results. Handle cases where we have bad or unclear inputs and ensure that client is notified. Manipulated search to be case insensitive for ease of use. Also designed IDL programs and established connection between servers and clients. Co-worked on the Makefile.

------------------------------------------------------------
Data Structures and Algorithms Used:
------------------------------------------------------------
Places Server:
-1D Array to hold states
-2D [State Index] [City Index] - Used to store the cities for corresponding state
-Linear search to find corresponding state (since state abbreviations are not in order even though states are AKA -> Maine = ME ...comes before... Maryland = MD)
-Binary search on the 2D array corresponding to given state index (since cities are in order)
-If found matching prefix, look above and below one index if possible to check if we also have a matching prefix. This let’s us check if we have to ask user to specify input.

Airports Server:
-Kd-tree to find nearest neighbor

5-Nearest return:
-Linked list of 5 nearest neighbors to return to client

------------------------------------------------------------
Strengths:
------------------------------------------------------------
-Binary search is extremely efficient in the places server to find cities (prefixed)

-Places server takes into account bad state input, bad city input, unclear input, and is case insensitive. If input is bad, airports server is not called, error message prints, and error number is set.

-Communication between the servers is clean and connected

-Data is read from places2k.txt once at runtime for places server prior to function call

------------------------------------------------------------
Weaknesses:
------------------------------------------------------------
-Currently the array for places server to hold data is static. Wanted avoid the memory leak problems for a dynamically allocated array. Also did this because we would have to read all the cities for a state before we know how much memory to allocate for each state in 2D array.

-Search for state in places server is linear due to non-ordered read of states (See above for reason). Could not find a better way to avoid this yet since we read the cities simultaneously into the 2D array to avoid double reading of txt file. 

------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions to run
------------------------------------------------------------
-Make
-Run ./airports_server&
-Run ./places_server&
-Run ./places_client localhost “city” state
-Kill servers when done

*state must be 2 chars, otherwise it is considered not a valid input.
